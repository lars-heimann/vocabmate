# Vocabmate

Vocabmate is an innovative tool designed to enhance your learning experience by leveraging advanced AI technology. With Vocabmate, you can effortlessly convert texts you want to be able to read into flashcards, making studying more efficient and effective.


## Features

- üìÅ Upload PDF slides or insert text
- üß† Generate up to 150 [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards with one click using GPT-4o or GPT-4o-mini by OpenAI
- üì§ Export generated flashcards by Vocabmate to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) with CSV file

## How does Vocabmate work?

Vocabmate first detects the input language. It then sends the text to a GPT (chatGPT) model to generate flashcards with AI. The generated flashcards are then displayed in the browser and can be exported to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

## FAQ

## Is Vocabmate associated with [AnkiGPT](ankigpt.help)?

Yes. AnkiGPT developed by [Nils Reichardt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilsreichardt/) has served as a major motivation in the ideation and creation of vocabmate. The frontend of vocabmate is based on the open source [AnkiGPT frontend](https://github.com/nilsreichardt/AnkiGPT). The backend of vocabmate however, is developed completely custom by [Lars Heimann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsheimann/).

### Is the source code of Vocabmate public?

Yes, the source code of the client for Vocabmate is public and can be accessed by anyone interested. You can explore or even contribute to the project by visiting the GitHub repository ([lars0530/vocabmate](https://github.com/lars0530/vocabmate)). However, it's important to note that while the client's code is open, the backend (including the prompts) is closed source. We greatly value community input and appreciate all contributions to improve Vocabmate.

### Which languages are supported?

Vocabmate is designed to be a globally accessible tool, and as such, it supports nearly all languages. This broad language coverage allows users from various linguistic backgrounds to utilize Vocabmate effectively. However, the level of support might vary depending on the language due to complexities in language structures and available datasets. We are consistently working on improving our support for all languages to ensure the best user experience possible.

### Which model is used for Vocabmate?

Vocabmate primarily utilizes the GPT-4o-mini by OpenAI model to generate flashcards, offering a seamless integration of advanced AI technology for effective learning. For users who opt for the Vocabmate Plus version, they gain the enhanced capability to generate up to XXX flashcards per month using the more advanced [GPT-4o model](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/), ensuring even more sophisticated and nuanced content creation.

### Is the content from my submitted texts used for AI training?

No, your submitted content is not used for AI training. Vocabmate leverages GPT models from OpenAI, which have a strong commitment to user privacy. OpenAI do not use customer-submitted data via their API to train or improve their models (Source: [API data usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies)). Your lecture slides content is only processed to create flashcards and is not used for any other purposes, ensuring your information remains private and secure.

### Does Vocabmate work with other flashcard apps than Anki?

As of now, Vocabmate is designed specifically to work with the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) flashcard app and we currently have no plans to extend support to other flashcard applications. This is to ensure the highest level of integration and functionality with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), thus providing an optimal user experience. We encourage users to utilize Vocabmate with the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) app for the best performance and reliability.

### What are the current limitations?

While Vocabmate is a powerful tool, it does have a few limitations to keep in mind:

- Firstly, remember that AI, including Vocabmate, is not infallible. There will be occasional errors in the generated flashcards, as with any AI technology. Always review your flashcards for accuracy.

- Secondly, GPT models, at the current stage of development, aren't particularly adept at handling mathematical equations and formulas. This might impact the quality of flashcards in these areas.

- Lastly, for users who utilize the PDF input feature, please note that it currently only processes text. Any images, including diagrams and pictures in the PDF, will be ignored.

We're continually working on refining and expanding Vocabmate's capabilities to improve your learning experience. Stay tuned for future updates and enhancements.

### Is it possible that the flashcards have incorrect information?

Yes, it's possible that the flashcards generated by Vocabmate may contain inaccuracies. Even with its advanced technology, AI is not perfect and can occasionally produce errors. Therefore, Vocabmate should be used as an assistant to your study process, not a replacement for creating your own flashcards. We recommend that users always review and cross-verify the information on the flashcards to ensure accuracy. We're continually working to improve the reliability and precision of our tool, but human oversight remains an important part of the process to guarantee quality learning outcomes.
